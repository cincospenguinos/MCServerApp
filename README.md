# MCServerApp

This is the code for my minecraft server webapp. It's intended to start the server on request
and do some other cool stuff. I'm putting it here so I don't lose it, and in case anyone else
wants to see what I did and totally steal it/make it better/make it not suck.

## TODO Items

- [ ] Create startup ability of the server
- [ ] Put together [Overviewer](http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/) map
- [ ] Create a means of registering
